# All files are revisions and combinations of previously written code.
# Modifications have been made to achieve the desired results.

# These codes together will operate a Point Grey Firefly MV 13SC2, taking 4 3.5s exposure rate color images at designated times.
# In addition to taking images, the Pi also communicates with an Arduino Uno to run a TSL25561 Luminosity sensor and a TV6612 motor
# driver to drive a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor.  

# This concept was used to cover and uncover a flashlight while taking readings of the luminosity during light cover.
# When the flashlight is covered, the camera will take its images.

# Please be on the look out for updates to these files as I clean them up and make additional changes.

# This is my first attempt at putting something I've worked on out so please leave comments!

# Enjoy!!
